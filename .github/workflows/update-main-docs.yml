      # we need to patch the autogenerated MD files
      # to make them compatible with GitBook
      # 1 - all tags should be lowercase eg
      # - [AssemblyResolver](#T-vBase-Infrastructure-AssemblyResolver 'vBase.Infrastructure.AssemblyResolver')
      # should be replaced with 
      # - [AssemblyResolver](#t-vbase-infrastructure-assemblyresolver 'vBase.Infrastructure.AssemblyResolver')
      # 2 - anchors should be moved next to the title eg
      # <a name='T-vBase-Infrastructure-AssemblyResolver'></a>
      # ## AssemblyResolver `type`
      # should be replaced with
      # ## AssemblyResolver `type` <a name='t-vbase-infrastructure-assemblyResolver'></a>
      # 3 - all anchors should be extended with id and href attributes eg
      # <a name='T-vBase-Infrastructure-AssemblyResolver'></a>
      # should be replaced with
      # <a id='t-vbase-infrastructure-assemblyresolver' name='t-vbase-infrastructure-assemblyresolver' href='#t-vbase-infrastructure-assemblyresolver'></a>
