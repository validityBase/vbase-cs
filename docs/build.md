## Add Nethereum.Web3 Package

1. **Check NuGet Sources:**
   Ensure that NuGet.org is configured as a package source. Run the following command to list available sources:
   ```cmd
   dotnet nuget list source
   ```
   If `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json` is missing, add it by running:
   ```cmd
   dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -n nuget.org
   ```

2. **Clear the NuGet Cache:**
   Sometimes, clearing the cache can resolve download issues:
   ```cmd
   dotnet nuget locals all --clear
   ```

3. **Try Installing Again:**
   After verifying the NuGet source and clearing the cache, try installing the package again:
   ```cmd
   dotnet add package Nethereum.Web3
   ```

4. **Manual Installation (If Needed):**
   If the issue persists, you can also install the package manually:
   - Download the `.nupkg` file from [NuGet.org for Nethereum.Web3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethereum.Web3/).
   - Use the following command to install the package from the local file:
     ```cmd
     dotnet add package Nethereum.Web3 --source <path-to-local-nupkg>
     ```
   
## Build a Project Targeting .NET Framework 4.8

To build a project targeting .NET Framework 4.8, you need to use the MSBuild version that comes with Visual Studio rather than `dotnet build`, as `dotnet build` uses the .NET SDK, which does not fully support .NET Framework-specific tasks like `RegisterAssembly`.

Here’s how you can build your .NET Framework 4.8 project:

1. **Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio:**
   - Open **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio** (not the regular command prompt).
   - This command prompt is configured to use the full MSBuild that supports .NET Framework tasks.

2. **Use MSBuild Command Directly:**
   - In the Developer Command Prompt, navigate to your project directory.
   - Run MSBuild directly to build the project:
     ```cmd
     msbuild VBase.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug
     ```
   - This will use the Visual Studio MSBuild, which supports .NET Framework 4.8, and should avoid the `RegisterAssembly` error.

3. **Confirm Project Targets .NET Framework 4.8:**
   - Ensure your `.csproj` file specifies `.NET Framework 4.8`:
     ```xml
     <TargetFramework>net48</TargetFramework>
     ```

4. **Run MSBuild as administrator:**
   - If you encounter permission issues, try running the MSBuild command as an administrator.
     - Close any open command prompts.
     - Find the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio in your Start menu.
     - Right-click on it and select Run as administrator.

## Register the signed DLL for COM Interop

### Step 1: Create a Strong Name Key File
1. Open a Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio.
2. Run the following command to generate a key file (e.g., `VBaseKey.snk`):
   ```cmd
   sn -k VBaseKey.snk
   ```

This will create a file named `VBaseKey.snk` in the current directory.

### Step 2: Sign the Assembly with the Key File
1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Properties**.
3. Go to the **Signing** tab.
4. Check **Sign the assembly**.
5. In the **Choose a strong name key file** dropdown, click **Browse...** and select the `VBaseKey.snk` file you created.

Alternatively, you can edit the `.csproj` file to include the following line within a `<PropertyGroup>`:

```xml
<AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile>VBaseKey.snk</AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile>
<SignAssembly>true</SignAssembly>
```

### Step 3: Rebuild the Project
After signing the assembly, rebuild your project.

### Step 4: Register the Signed Assembly
Now that your assembly is signed, you can use `regasm` to register it without the warning:

```cmd
regasm /codebase "c:\Users\greg\My Documents\validityBase\vbase-cs\vbase\bin\Debug\net48\VBase.dll"
```

This should register your assembly without the warning. The strong name ensures that your assembly is uniquely identifiable, reducing the risk of conflicts.

## Register the DLL for COM Interop

1. **Build the Project** as Administrator (since registry access is required).
2. **Register the Assembly for COM**:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Run the following command to register your DLL for COM interop:
     ```cmd
     regasm /codebase bin\Debug\net48\VBase.dll
     ```

## Test the DLL

The error occurs because `UnregisterAssembly` is a COM interop task that requires .NET Framework MSBuild, and it’s not compatible with `dotnet test`, which uses .NET Core MSBuild. Since your project needs COM interop and targets .NET Framework, here’s how to address the issue:

To test a .NET Framework project with COM interop, avoid `dotnet test` and instead use the **Visual Studio test runner** or **MSBuild**. Both will use the .NET Framework MSBuild, which supports the COM interop tasks.

### Option 1: Use Visual Studio's Test Explorer

1. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio**:
   - Open your solution in Visual Studio (ensure it's the version that supports .NET Framework 4.8).
   
2. **Run Tests in Test Explorer**:
   - Go to **Test > Test Explorer**.
   - In the Test Explorer window, click **Run All**. This will use the .NET Framework MSBuild, bypassing the compatibility issue with COM interop tasks.

### Option 2: Run Tests Using MSBuild Command

Alternatively, you can run tests directly using MSBuild, which is installed with Visual Studio and supports COM interop tasks. 

1. Open the **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio** (this ensures it uses the .NET Framework MSBuild).
   
2. **Run the Test Target**:
   - In the command prompt, navigate to your test project folder and run:
     ```cmd
     msbuild VBase.Tests.csproj /t:Build /p:Configuration=Debug
     ```

This command will build the tests using the .NET Framework MSBuild, which supports COM interop.

3. Run the Tests:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\greg\Documents\validityBase\vbase-cs\VBase.Tests
   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\Extensions\TestPlatform\vstest.console.exe" bin\Debug\net48\VBase.Tests.dll
   ```
  
4. Step 3: Clear the NuGet Cache

Sometimes, clearing the NuGet cache can fix permissions issues:
    ```cmd
    dotnet nuget locals all --clear
    ```

After clearing the cache, try restoring again:
    ```cmd
    dotnet restore
    ```

## Call the C# Method from VBA

In Excel VBA, you can now create an instance of the `VBaseClient` class and call `CallSmartContractFunction`.

1. Open the VBA editor in Excel (Alt + F11).
2. Go to **Tools > References**, and add a reference to your COM-visible DLL.
3. Write VBA code to use `VBaseClient`:

   ```vba
   Sub CallSmartContract()
       Dim vbaseClient As Object
       Set vbaseClient = CreateObject("VBase.VBaseClient")

       Dim rpcUrl As String
       Dim privateKey As String
       Dim contractAddress As String
       Dim abi As String
       Dim functionName As String
       Dim functionInput(0 To 0) As Variant

       rpcUrl = "https://your_rpc_url"
       privateKey = "your_private_key"
       contractAddress = "your_contract_address"
       abi = "your_contract_abi"
       functionName = "functionName"
       functionInput(0) = "input_value" ' Replace with actual inputs

       Dim transactionHash As String
       transactionHash = vbaseClient.CallSmartContractFunction(rpcUrl, privateKey, contractAddress, abi, functionName, functionInput)

       MsgBox "Transaction Hash: " & transactionHash
   End Sub
   ```

This VBA code will call the C# function synchronously and display the transaction hash returned by the smart contract function.
